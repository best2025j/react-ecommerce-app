Phase	Focus on Building:
âœ… Phase 1	Auth (register/login with JWT, bcrypt, protected routes). done

âœ… Phase 2	Products CRUD (only admin can create/update/delete).done

âœ… Phase 3	Cart (user adds/removes products).done

âœ… Phase 4	Orders (checkout, order history)
âœ… Phase 5	Payment Integration (optional, fake data or Stripe later)



Add order status (pending, paid, shipped, etc.).

Store cart in DB for persistence (if needed).

Admin access to view/manage all orders.


ðŸ§¾ 3. Order Model and Routes
Start creating orders (cart/checkout).

Create Order model:

userId

products: [{ productId, quantity }]

totalPrice

isPaid

paidAt

Routes:

POST /api/orders (protected)

GET /api/orders/:id (protected)

GET /api/orders/myorders (protected)

Admin: GET /api/orders (all)




ðŸ‘¤ 4. User Profile & Admin Controls
GET /api/users/profile (protected)

PUT /api/users/profile (protected)

Admin:

GET /api/users

PUT /api/users/:id

DELETE /api/users/:id



ðŸ’³ 5. Payment Integration (Optional)
You can add:

Stripe / PayPal integration for checking out

Simulate payment for learning



ðŸ§ª 6. Test All Routes with Postman
Be sure to test:

Authorization headers (Bearer <token>)

Body data and expected responses

Protected routes with and without token

ðŸ’¡ Final Suggestions:
Organize code into routes, controllers, models, and middleware

Use dotenv to manage secret keys

Add error handling middleware

Add logging (e.g., morgan)

Connect to MongoDB Atlas (you already know how to link this)
